# Hibernate Entity Graph
 In Hibernate/JPA we face N+1 Problem. First we will see what is the N+1 Problem.
 
 In order to find, what is N+1 Problem Please go through the below stackoverflow link

 We can fix N+1 select problem by using Entity Graphs provided by JPA 2.1. we can achieve following ways. 
 
 - Using Entity Manager
 - Using JPA Repository
 - Using 3rd Party Entity Graph Utility
  
```mermaid
graph TD
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using Entity Manager Class | B(Hibernate Entity Manager )
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using JPA Repository Class | C(JPA Repository )
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using 3rd Party Entity Graph | D(3rd Party Entity Graph Utility )
```
In this example we will use Hibernate Entity Manager to solve N+1 problem.

```mermaid
graph TD
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using Entity Manager Class | B(Hibernate Entity Manager )
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using JPA Repository Class | C(JPA Repository )
	A[Entity Graph] -->|Using 3rd Party Entity Graph | D(3rd Party Entity Graph Utility )
	
	B[Hibernate Entity Manager] --> | Using Named Entity Graph API | E(NamedEntityGraph)
	B[Hibernate Entity Manager] --> | Using Dynamically pass graph attribute nodes | G(Dynamic Entity Graph API)
	B[Hibernate Entity Manager] --> | Using Root Entity Graph API | H(RootGraph API)
```
